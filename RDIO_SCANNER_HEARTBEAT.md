# Rdio Scanner heartbeat integration

sdrtrunk can send an online heartbeat for each enabled Rdio Scanner streaming destination. This is separate from the
normal completed-call upload and is disabled by default for compatibility with existing Rdio Scanner servers.

## Configure sdrtrunk

Open **Playlist Editor > Streaming**, select the Rdio Scanner destination, and configure:

- **Send Heartbeat:** enables heartbeat delivery.
- **Heartbeat Interval (seconds):** normal delivery interval, with a minimum of 5 seconds.
- **Heartbeat URL:** optional full POST URL for your monitoring application. When blank, sdrtrunk changes the
  configured call URL from `/api/call-upload` to `/api/heartbeat`.

For example, a call URL of `https://scanner.example/api/call-upload` uses
`https://scanner.example/api/heartbeat` unless a different heartbeat URL is entered.

The normal completed-call request remains a multipart POST to `<Rdio Scanner URL>/api/call-upload`.

## HTTP request contract

The heartbeat is an HTTP `POST` with these headers:

```http
POST /api/heartbeat HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
User-Agent: sdrtrunk
X-SDRTrunk-Event: heartbeat
X-RdioScanner-System-Id: 42
X-API-Key: your-rdio-api-key
```

The API key is sent only in the `X-API-Key` header and is not included in the JSON body.

Example body:

```json
{
  "event": "heartbeat",
  "status": "online",
  "connected": true,
  "timestamp": 1790150400000,
  "timestampIso": "2026-09-23T08:00:00Z",
  "application": "sdrtrunk",
  "version": "0.7.0-beta-12",
  "destination": "County Rdio",
  "hostname": "scanner-pi",
  "uptimeMs": 86400000,
  "systemId": 42,
  "queuedCalls": 0
}
```

Field meanings:

- `event`: always `heartbeat`.
- `status`: always `online` while the application is running.
- `connected`: whether the Rdio destination was connected when the body was created.
- `timestamp`: Unix time in milliseconds.
- `timestampIso`: the same timestamp in ISO-8601 UTC format.
- `application` and `version`: sender identity.
- `destination`: the Rdio destination name from Playlist Editor.
- `hostname`: host name of the sdrtrunk computer or Raspberry Pi.
- `uptimeMs`: Java application runtime in milliseconds.
- `systemId`: configured Rdio Scanner system ID.
- `queuedCalls`: completed calls currently waiting in the Rdio upload queue.

Return any HTTP status from `200` through `299` to accept the heartbeat. Network errors, timeouts, and non-2xx
responses put the destination into a temporary error state, replace the HTTP client, and retry with exponential
backoff capped at 60 seconds or the configured heartbeat interval, whichever is shorter.

## Node/Express receiver example

```javascript
const crypto = require('node:crypto');
const scannerStatus = new Map();

function validApiKey(value) {
  const expected = process.env.SDRTRUNK_RDIO_API_KEY || '';
  const supplied = value || '';
  const a = Buffer.from(expected);
  const b = Buffer.from(supplied);
  return a.length > 0 && a.length === b.length && crypto.timingSafeEqual(a, b);
}

app.post('/api/heartbeat', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  if (req.get('X-SDRTrunk-Event') !== 'heartbeat') {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'not a heartbeat' });
  }

  if (!validApiKey(req.get('X-API-Key'))) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'invalid API key' });
  }

  const systemId = Number(req.get('X-RdioScanner-System-Id'));
  const heartbeat = req.body;

  scannerStatus.set(systemId, {
    online: true,
    lastSeen: Date.now(),
    connected: heartbeat.connected,
    queuedCalls: heartbeat.queuedCalls,
    destination: heartbeat.destination,
    hostname: heartbeat.hostname,
    version: heartbeat.version
  });

  return res.sendStatus(204);
});
```

Your application can consider the scanner offline when `lastSeen` is older than two or three configured heartbeat
intervals. Compare API keys using a constant-time comparison when exposing the endpoint outside a trusted network,
and use HTTPS for any non-local connection.
